# Intorduction
In this project, I worked on real data provided from both websites owned by The Recording Academy, the non-profit organization behind the famous Grammy Awards. I took on the task of examining the effect of splitting up the two websites, and analyzing the data for a better understanding of trends and audience behavior on both websites.

I then chose to compare my findings against grammy.com's number one competitor, The American Music Awards (theAMA.com), to further elaborate upon recommendations for the developers at grammy.com to optimize their presence in the marketplace. 

# Background
My goal for this project was to be able to both demonstrate and hone my excel skillset to best transform and analyze the provided datasets for optimal business insights. Throughout the process I employed several different types of analytical tools with excel, such as:

- Advanced Formulas
- Statistical Analysis
- Pivot Tables
- A/B Testing
- Data Visualizations
