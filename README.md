# Intorduction
In this project, I worked on real data provided from both websites owned by The Recording Academy, the non-profit organization behind the famous Grammy Awards. I took on the task of examining the effect of splitting up the two websites, and analyzing the data for a better understanding of trends and audience behavior on both websites.

I then chose to compare my findings against grammy.com's number one competitor, The American Music Awards (theAMA.com), to further elaborate upon recommendations for KPI improvements to the developers at grammy.com to optimize their presence within the marketplace. 

# Background
My goal for this project was to be able to both demonstrate and hone my excel skillset to best transform and analyze the provided datasets for optimal business insights. Throughout the process I employed several different types of analytical tools with excel, such as:

- Advanced Formulas
- Statistical Analysis
- Pivot Tables
- A/B Testing
- Data Visualizations

# Objectives for the Project
1. Explore the Data
2. Analyze the Data
3. Device Breakdown
4. Communicate Findings
5. A/B Testing

# Tools I Used

- **Excel** was my primary tool employed to handle everything from data cleaning, transformation and visualization. I decided to use solely excel in order to best demonstrate my developed skillset with the software. 
- Version control was managed through **GitHub**, allowing for systematic tracking of changes, collaboration, and ensuring the integrity of the project's codebase.

# The Analysis

### Explore the Data

Before analyzing any dataset within excel I am always sure to reference the data dictionary provided to better understand the values within all records (rows) and categorys (columns) within a dataset.

| Column  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| date  | The data the data was captured |
| visitors  | The number of visitors that came to the website on the given date |
| pageviews | The total number of pageviews from all sessions on the given date |
| sessions | The number of unique sessions on the website on the given date. A session is a visit from a user to a webpage in a given time period. If they leave and come back later that would count as two sessions |
| bounced_sessions | The total number of sessions on the given date where the user did not interact with any content on the page |
| avg_session_durations_sec | The average session length in seconds for all sessions on the given date |
| event_type | Whether the date was a regular day or the day the Grammy Awards were being held |
| mobile_visitors | The number of visitors that came from a iOS, Android, or Tablet device on the given date |

I then created a line chart of the number of daily visitors to the Grammy.com website. This visualization helped me spot the days the Grammy Awards themselves were hosted.
